# Intro

#### What is Ripio SDK js?

Ripio SDK js is a library written in javascript that allows you to interact with any EVM. As a main feature, Ripio SDK grants simplicity in writing code to transact on blockchain. It has 3 layers of abstraction that goes from, the most generic in terms of interaction with Smart Contracts, to a more oriented design for each of the use cases/industries where you can develop a dApp. Ripio SDK js uses Ethers js to perform the interaction with the blockchain while simplifying its use.
